# Digital Beehive

ðŸŽ“ Developed & designed during my 2017 work experience @plymouthuni using bootstrap.   

The goal of the work experience was to develop a "mock" digital agency where we worked with two real clients on seperate projects. My role in the two week long experience was in design and web development.  Contributing to some of the brand elements as well as the whole design and development of the site.

**Disclaimer:** The site is by no means a finished product, having only two days to work on it in 2017.
